# github-search-api-using-javascript
A search box in which user can add any valid id and then all public repository of that valid id will be listed down.

Search webpage is completely made up of jquery and javascript. No framework used.

When user stats entering any valid name in the search and on clicking on search button, it will list down all the repository details in the card. Example - Suposse , you started enter watermelon, so on clicking card, it will listed the repository detail of watermelon along with each alphabet with which you stated. So, in the response you can see, all "W" repo, then all "A" repo ans so on. till complete "wtermelon" word.

And if no description was guven by any use for the repo, I have handled that case too, so in the card , you'll see dummy content intead of null.

And the time, I'm displaying time in local standard time. I have converted date time in to local Time (IST). We can change in any other format also.
